# This R script contains some of the macroecological analyses of scorpions assemblages from Sri Lanka

**reg.loess.R**: is the function to run a [local polynomial fitting (LOESS)](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00122-008-0788-1) using two matrices as input. This script was adapted from Jaff√© et al. [(2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12794); the original version can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/rojaff/Lplot). Adaptations made in the original script were no more than simple adjustements to optimize the graphical visualization of the results.
